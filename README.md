# Neural-Network-Implementation-from-scratch-Python
This repository contains two implementations for a feedforward neural network capable to clasify the three iris flowers classes from the iris data set. For a better understanding of the neural network, writing the algorithms is a big help.

The data set used for training and testing is the iris data set, both of them are capable to clasify the three classes of iris flowers. These implementations are from scratch coded in Python using only numpy for mathematical operations. Both of them use:
